            <h1>How We Started</h1>
            <p> Rexys Rocket Dogs was born on the night of October 6th. Founders Hailey Ryan and Sam Taylor were deciding what adventures they would embark on that week.
                Upon brainstorming an idea for a hot dog stand emerged. They spent minutes meticulously planning details like location, costs, purpose, and marketing.
                Less than two days later they headed to campus and began to set up for hungry customers who would soon leave BYU-Idaho's tuesday devotional. 
                As the line formed and Baha Men's "Who Let The Dogs Out" played on repeat. The legacy of Rexys Rocket Dogs was formed, and has continued every week since.</p>
